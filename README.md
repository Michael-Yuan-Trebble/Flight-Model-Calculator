# Flight-Model-Calculator

## Flight Model Calculator: A Desktop application to calculate certain aircraft values, written in Python and using PyQT5 and pyqtgraph.

I built this project to teach myself PyQt5 for GUI development and PyQTgraph for interactive plotting.
My goals for the project are to gain hands-on experience in:
- Building desktop applications with a responsive user interface
- Integrate real-time graphing and visualization
- Learning event-driven programming in Python

## Features
- Interactive GUI with PyQT5
- Graphing with PyQTgraph
- Calculates and visualizes:
  - Lift Curve vs AoA
  - Instantaneous turn rate across different Mach speeds
  - Sustained turn rate across different Mach speeds
- User configurable aircraft parameters:
  - Wing Area, Thrust, CL values
- Altitude affects on air performance
